Another experiment in Streamlit, this time utilizing Ollama. 
Don't take this very seriously, it's just for fun (and practice). 
I am trying to build towards a stock portfolio using Streamlit, so 
this is mostly just to play around with streamlit and too see if I can 
get it to work. 

And also partly because the buzz-word bonanaza at LinkedIn is quite annoying. 

I really relied heavyily on chatgpt here, but I learned a bit and had a bunch of fun.
